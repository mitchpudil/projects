# Misc. Statistics Research Projects
These are other research projects I have worked on as a statisics and economics double major at BYU. 


#### heartdisease2.R:
Uses back, forward, and stepwise regression to determine the factors related to receiving cardiovascular  diseases.

#### Grades.sas:
Looks at the statistics of the GPA of previous students at BYU, using SAS and Proc SQL. 

#### STEM.R:
Determines the probability of switching from a STEM major, using R. 

#### Diamonds:
Uses SAS and Proc SQL to determine the effect of carat size on diamond ring price. Includes transformation of variables for regression, prediction interval (with graph), and computations for un-transformed R sq. and mean absolute prediction error. 
Process also completed in R. 

#### Birthweight_Analysis.R

A look into how various factors such as mother's age, race, and gestational age affects the birthweight of a child, with a focus on showing the validity of multiple regression though K-S tests, Breusch-Pagan, and Monte Carlo Cross Validation. 

#### Movies.R
Used a glm model robust to heteroskedasticity to determine how much revenue a movie studio should expect to receive for each dollar of production budget invested in a film. Also looked at if higher production budget films are more variable in the domestic gross and hat films under vs. overperformed domestically relative to their predicted domestic gross. Also used a Monte Carlo simulation to run a cross-validation of the heterogeneous MLR.
