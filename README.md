# Statistics Research Projects
These are other research projects I have worked on as a statisics and economics double major at BYU. The code in this repository is written primarily in R, but includes SAS and Proc SQL commands as well.

#### Age-Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) Analysis
Uses a GLS model which accounts for within-subject correlation to determine (1)if patients on the interferon-alpha treatment have a significantly higher vision score after a year than those not on the treatment,(2) if the treatment stops vision loss over time, and (3) if patients on/off the drug with a baseline of 29 are at risk of going legally blind. Optimization techniques also explored using the optim() function. 

#### Arches
Predictions of visitors to Arches National Park, using a seasonal ARIMA model

#### Birthweight Analysis

A look into how various factors such as mother's age, race, and gestational age affects the birthweight of a child, with a focus on showing the validity of multiple regression though K-S tests, Breusch-Pagan, and Monte Carlo Cross Validation. 

#### Climate Analysis

Uses SARIMA model to predict temperature anomalies in the next few years.

#### Diamonds
Uses SAS and Proc SQL to determine the effect of carat size on diamond ring price. Includes transformation of variables for regression, prediction interval (with graph), and computations for un-transformed R sq. and mean absolute prediction error. 
Process also completed in R. 


#### Food Expenditures
Uses a glm model robust to heteroskedasticity along with cross-validation to model and predict the amount of money an individual will spend eating out given income.

#### Game of Thrones (GOT)
Time series analysis of Game of Thrones data to predict viewership of future seasons. Employs a SARIMA(2,0,0,0,1,1)\_10 model with cross-validation.


#### Grades
Looks at the statistics of the GPA of previous students at BYU, using SAS and Proc SQL. 


#### Greenhouse
Looks at the effects of various gases on average global temperature. Analysis in R and SAS, with unofficial report in LaTeX.


#### Heart Disease
Uses back, forward, and stepwise regression to determine the factors related to receiving cardiovascular  diseases.


#### Movies
Used a GLS model robust to heteroskedasticity to determine how much revenue a movie studio should expect to receive for each dollar of production budget invested in a film. Also looked at if higher production budget films are more variable in the domestic gross and hat films under vs. overperformed domestically relative to their predicted domestic gross. Also used a Monte Carlo simulation to run a cross-validation of the heterogeneous MLR.

#### Scottish Hills
Uses Scottish hill racing (fell running) data to look at influential observations and outliers in data. Coded in R and in SAS. Includes unofficial report in LaTeX. 

#### Statistics Pedagogy
Group project (one other) to determine the relevance of homework, quizzes, and midterms on average student grade in introductory statistics using a GLS model robust to heteroskedasticity.

#### STEM
Determines the probability of switching from a STEM major, using logistic regression.
