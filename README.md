# Statistics-Research
Misc. Statistics Research Projects
These are other research projects I have worked on as a statisics and economics double major at BYU. \n 
Briefly: \n
Grades.sas looks at the statistics of the GPA of previous students at BYU, using SAS and Proc SQL.  \n
STEM.R determines the probability of switching from a STEM major, using R.  \n
heartdisease2.R uses back, forward, and stepwise regression to determine the factors related to receiving cardiovascular  \n diseases.
