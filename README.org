#+TITLE: Statistics and Economics Projects

For an organized list of all assignments, with information and links, see the
tables below.

All the assignments are tagged with relevant topical designations to
help you find problems of interest. Five special tags represent broad 
groupings that match key course themes. These are:

1.  =Statistical Computing= Algorithms, data structures, recursion, object-oriented programming
2. =Statistical Modeling= Projects involving statistical modeling
3. =Machine Learning and NLP= Machine learning and NLP projects including dimensionality reduction, unsupervised, and supervised learning
4. =Economics Projects= Various economics projects from my BYU undergrad
5. =SQL= SQL practice and challenges
