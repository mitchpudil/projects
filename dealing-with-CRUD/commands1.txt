Observations:

The average height, in inches, of basketball positions are:

power forward   | 79.38
 shooting guard | 78.87
 center         | 79.21
 point guard    | 79.43

So point guards are the tallest, and shooring gruards are the shortest, but not by much.
The average height in all positions are still really tall (6'7" average, more or less)
